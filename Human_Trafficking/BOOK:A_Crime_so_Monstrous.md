A Crime So Monstrous — General Summary

In A Crime So Monstrous, journalist E. Benjamin Skinner investigates the persistence of modern-day slavery in the contemporary world. Contrary to the widespread belief that slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century, Skinner demonstrates that tens of millions of people remain enslaved today through systems of coercion, violence, debt, and deception.

The book is structured as a global investigation. Skinner travels across multiple continents—particularly Haiti, Sudan, India, and Eastern Europe—to document different forms of modern slavery. These include child domestic servitude, debt bondage, forced labor, sexual exploitation, and slavery linked to armed conflict. Through firsthand interviews with enslaved individuals, traffickers, employers, activists, and government officials, Skinner exposes how slavery adapts to local economic and political conditions.

A central theme of the book is that modern slavery is cheap, disposable, and hidden. Unlike historical chattel slavery, enslaved people today are often not legally owned but are controlled through threats, debt, isolation, and lack of legal protection. This makes slavery both harder to detect and easier to deny. Victims are frequently migrants, children, ethnic minorities, or members of the extreme poor—people with little access to justice.

Skinner also explores the economic logic of contemporary slavery. He shows how global demand for cheap labor, weak enforcement of labor laws, corruption, and indifference allow exploitative systems to flourish. Slavery persists not because it is illegal, but because it is profitable and rarely punished.

The book pays close attention to the role of institutions and governments, particularly the uneven response of powerful states. Skinner highlights both failures and successes in anti-slavery efforts, including the work of NGOs, local activists, and certain government initiatives. He is especially critical of symbolic commitments that lack enforcement and of policies that prioritize political convenience over human rights.

In its final sections, A Crime So Monstrous argues that modern slavery is neither accidental nor inevitable. Skinner contends that it survives because societies tolerate it—through neglect, denial, and weak accountability. He calls for stronger legal enforcement, international cooperation, economic pressure, and sustained public attention to dismantle systems of exploitation.

Ultimately, the book is both an exposé and a moral challenge. It forces readers to confront the uncomfortable reality that slavery is not a relic of the past, but an embedded feature of the modern global economy—and that ending it requires sustained political will rather than mere outrage.
