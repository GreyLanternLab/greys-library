# We Are Bellingcat — General Summary
*Eliot Higgins*

## Overview
*We Are Bellingcat* tells the story of the creation and evolution of Bellingcat, an open-source investigative collective founded by Eliot Higgins. The book documents how ordinary citizens, using publicly available information and digital tools, can conduct investigations traditionally reserved for intelligence agencies, journalists, and governments.

The narrative combines memoir, case studies, and methodological reflection, showing how open-source intelligence (OSINT) has transformed investigative journalism and accountability in the digital age.

## Origins of Bellingcat
Higgins begins by describing how Bellingcat emerged from online communities analyzing the Syrian civil war. Using YouTube videos, social media posts, satellite imagery, and geolocation techniques, volunteers began identifying weapons, perpetrators, and movements of military forces. These early efforts demonstrated that publicly available data could reveal truths hidden by propaganda and official denial.

## Methodology: How Open-Source Investigations Work
A central focus of the book is *how* Bellingcat operates. Higgins explains core OSINT techniques such as:
- Verification of user-generated content  
- Geolocation and chronolocation  
- Cross-referencing social media, satellite imagery, and databases  
- Collaborative investigation across borders  

The book emphasizes transparency: Bellingcat publishes not only conclusions, but also the evidence and methods used, allowing others to verify or challenge the findings.

## Major Investigations
Higgins recounts several landmark investigations, including:
- The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17  
- Chemical weapons use in Syria  
- Russian military involvement in Ukraine  
- Identification of intelligence operatives involved in poisonings and assassinations  

These cases illustrate how open-source investigations can challenge state narratives and contribute to legal, political, and journalistic accountability.

## Community and Collaboration
Bellingcat is portrayed not as a traditional organization, but as a **distributed community** of researchers, journalists, technologists, and volunteers. Higgins highlights how collaboration, peer review, and collective expertise strengthen investigations and reduce individual bias or error.

---

## Risks, Attacks, and Disinformation
The book also addresses the risks faced by open-source investigators. Bellingcat and its contributors have been subjected to harassment, legal threats, disinformation campaigns, and accusations of bias. Higgins explains how transparency and methodological rigor are used as defenses against these attacks.

## The Political Impact of OSINT
Higgins argues that OSINT has shifted the balance of power in information warfare. Governments and powerful actors can no longer fully control narratives when citizens can independently verify events. At the same time, the book warns that open information can be misused, requiring ethical responsibility and critical thinking.

## The Future of Investigation
In its final sections, *We Are Bellingcat* reflects on the future of journalism, accountability, and civic investigation. Higgins suggests that open-source investigation will continue to grow in importance, especially as digital traces become unavoidable. However, success depends on education, collaboration, and a commitment to evidence over ideology.

## Key Themes
- Open-source intelligence as a tool for accountability  
- Transparency and reproducibility in investigations  
- Collective intelligence over individual authority  
- The democratization of investigative power  
- The challenges of disinformation and political pressure

## Conclusion
*We Are Bellingcat* presents a powerful argument that truth-seeking is no longer limited to institutions with privileged access. By showing how careful, transparent analysis of open data can expose wrongdoing, the book challenges traditional ideas about who gets to investigate the world—and how.
