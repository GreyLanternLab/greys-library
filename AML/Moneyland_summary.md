# Moneyland — Chapter Summaries
*Oliver Bullough*

---

## 1. Aladdin’s Cave
Bullough opens with the metaphor of Moneyland as a glittering, hidden world—like Aladdin’s cave—that hides vast sums of wealth invisible to citizens and regulators. The chapter sets the tone by tracing how stolen public money becomes accessible to kleptocrats through offshore secrecy. 

---

## 2. Pirates
This chapter examines how post-Soviet power struggles created a new class of wealth — kleptocrats and oligarchs — who used offshore finance to protect, invest, and conceal their stolen assets. The metaphor of pirates illustrates predatory appropriation and escape from law enforcement. 

---

## 3. Queen of the Caribbees
Bullough travels to Caribbean jurisdictions like St Kitts and Nevis, where island governments became architects of sovereignty-selling schemes such as investor citizenship programs, attracting the super-rich and corrupt alike. 

---

## 4. Sex, Lies and Offshore Vehicles
Exploring how shell companies, trusts, and nominee structures provide anonymity, this chapter shows how otherwise opaque financial vehicles facilitate tax avoidance and conceal the true ownership of assets. 


## 5. Mystery on Harley Street
Bullough investigates the London property market as a primary storage for hidden wealth. Hedge funds, shell companies, and anonymous ownership have turned British real estate into a “warehouse” for Moneyland, with little regulation. 

---

## 6. Shell Games
The chapter dives into the legal and institutional mechanics — how law firms and banks design ever-more complex corporate structures that deliberately hide beneficial owners and evade scrutiny. 

---

## 7. Cancer
Bullough uses the metaphor of cancer to describe how kleptocratic finance metastasizes. Starting from individual theft, it spreads through global banking, property, and trust systems, undermining states’ fiscal capacities and accountability. 

---

## 8. Nasty as a Rattlesnake
This chapter highlights the opposition to Moneyland enforcement — regulators, prosecutors, and civil society — and shows how difficult it is to pursue corruption internationally. Laws are weak, and secrecy jurisdictions fight transparency. 

---

## 9. The Man Who Sells Passports
Bullough focuses on citizenship-by-investment schemes and how wealthy individuals with blood on their hands can buy the privileges of Western passports, enabling mobility and legal protection. 

---

## 10. “Diplomatic Immunity!”
Here the narrative explores diplomatic avenues used to shield assets and people — from embassies to political influence — showing how legal immunities become financial loopholes. 

---

## 11. Un-write-about-able
This chapter addresses the silencing effect of Moneyland’s elite: legal pressure, litigation threats, and media capture that protect wealthy interests from exposure. 

---

## 12. Dark Matter
Bullough borrows a physics metaphor to describe the hidden infrastructure of global finance — the trust industry, anonymous companies, and opaque registries — which exert enormous influence despite being unseen. 

---

## 13. “Nuclear Death Is Knocking Your Door”
In this more dramatic chapter title, Bullough discusses extreme cases of corruption and geopolitical violence, where fenced-off wealth relates to warlords, arms deals, and destabilizing actors. 

---

## 14. Say Yes to the Money
The focus here is on incentives: why political and business elites choose complicity. Governments subsidize secrecy and offshore growth because of the capital inflows benefiting domestic sectors. 

---

## 15. High-End Property
A deeper look at how wealthy individuals invest in global real estate — from London to Manhattan — driving price inflation and concentrating wealth among invisible owners, displacing local residents. 

---

## 16. Plutos Like to Hang Out Together
Bullough examines elite networks and social ecosystems — private clubs, investment forums, and social registers — where wealth accumulates and reinforces power across borders. 

---

## 17. Breaking Switzerland
This chapter recounts efforts to pierce Swiss banking secrecy, including leaks, scandals, and policy shifts that challenged traditional safe havens, though often with limited effectiveness. 

---

## 18. Tax Haven USA
Bullough explains how specific US states (e.g., Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota) have become de facto tax havens with trust laws and corporate secrecy rivaling Cayman Islands, attracting foreign wealth. 

---

## 19. Standing Up to Moneyland
The penultimate chapter highlights activists, journalists, and investigators fighting back: leaks (Panama Papers), anti-money-laundering efforts, and civil society pushing for transparency. 

---

## 20. Something rotten
Bullough wraps up, arguing that Moneyland persists because democracies tolerate it for economic gain. Ending with a call to action, he suggests reforms — transparency registers, global cooperation, and enforcement — to reclaim accountability.
